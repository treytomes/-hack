# Features

## Health Regen

When you begin resting ("r"), a rest timer begins to increment.  Every time you rest a d20 is rolled.  If the result of the d20 is less than the rest count + constitution modifier, you will receive +1 restored HP.

What this means in-game is that the odds of your health being restored increase the longer you rest, with it maxing out to definitely healing after 20 turns at rest.
