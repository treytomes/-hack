# Synopsis

You are hired by the human villagers of a mining town to investigate the disappearance of a group of dwarven miners who disappeared after breaking through to a lower level of the mine. You discover that there is something sinister at play in the mine, as undead creatures become more common the deeper you go. As you explore further, you discover that a malevolent dwarven chemist has been experimenting with enhancing the power of the cordyceps fungus, creating a powerful new weapon that turns its victims into mindless zombies.

You must navigate through treacherous caverns filled with deadly traps and infected creatures to reach the chemist's lair and stop his evil plans before they can spread beyond the mine and threaten the entire valley. Along the way, you must contend with rival factions and dangerous monsters that seek to use the enhanced fungus for their own purposes. With the fate of the mining town hanging in the balance, you must use all of their skills and abilities to uncover the secrets of the mine and stop the evil dwarf chemist before it's too late.

# Key Bindings
**Review `keybindings.ms` for the implementation.**

* left = left arrow
* right = right arrow
* up = up arrow
* down = down arrow
* inventory = i
* rest = r
* drop = d
* get = g

# Strategies

* Take time to rest `r` every chance you get.  Rest long enough and you'll start getting some of that HP back.
* Wait for the enemy to come to you.  There's no special game mechanics in place (yet!) to reward rushing in head-first.
* Try to stand just at the range of a single enemy's vision, wait for them to start charging you, then retreat to a safe distance so you can fight them one at a time.
    * Might not work.  Some enemies will follow eachother into battle.
